# BrutePy

please excuse any spelling/gramatical issues, I'm tired and it's late.

This is a python brutforce tool that could be added to and/or redesigned to be better for a specific target.
Examples of redesign:
  1. Adding a proxy rotation to defeat basic bot defenders.
  2. using requests instead of searching for forms on the page.
  3. customizing password requirements to decrease run-time.
  4. use multi threading to generate a password list and save to a file and read from the file and request
  5. add a utility that tests all the passwords from a certian length down (ie. len 6, len 5, len 4, ...)
  6. anything else you come up with, please message me at a_personlol#2828 on discord.
  
Anyway, I should include instructions, right?
Bsically, you should specify the ID or class of the target feild in the form as idFeilds(userID=ID, passID=ID)
You also want to specify the character set in the variable charSet (big brain time)
The program will ask for reps. This is just the lenegth of the password.
It could use some more comments, but I think you can figure out the rest.
  
This is my first python project that has a good use and is not some random crap. 
Anyway, like I said, please message with feedback if you have it.

Disclaimer: If you use my tool for any illegal reasons, i am not responsible. You are. 
Don't @ me because you got arrested for bruteforcing your roblox girlfriends account to see if she was cheating.
